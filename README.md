# D.A.R.V.I.S. Client release only repository
This repository is kept to prevent [D.A.R.V.I.S.](https://darvis.davchennai.org)' Import/Export feature from breaking, since it requires an executable to be downloaded from the Releases page.

I am not involved with Team DARVIS any more, so I can't remove the feature from the application. This app is written in Python and compiled with Pyinstaller, so it should be possible to obtain the source code from the binary. I don't have the source code with me anymore, however, if I end up finding it, I'll upload it to my personal website.
